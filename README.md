## 📌 About The Project

Prompt GuardX is a real-time, session-aware security layer that acts as a firewall for AI prompts. It protects AI applications from prompt injections and jailbreak attempts through intelligent monitoring, risk scoring, and automatic intervention.

### 🔥 The Problem

As LLMs like cohere become widely adopted, they are increasingly vulnerable to:
- Prompt injection attacks
- Jailbreak attempts
- Multi-turn dialogue manipulation (slowburn attacks)

Current solutions rely on static filters that can't detect context-aware attacks or evolve with user interaction.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Multi-Turn Prompt Tracking**: Analyzes the entire conversation history
- **🔍 Real-Time Risk Analysis**: Uses GPT-4 to evaluate each new prompt
- **⚖️ Dynamic Risk Scoring**: Assigns a risk score (0-100) to every prompt
- **🚨 Auto-Intervention**: Blocks or rewrites risky prompts
- **📊 Threat Logging**: Provides developer-friendly explanations
- **🔐 PII Redaction**: Protects sensitive user information

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/promptguardX.git
cd promptguardian-pro
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file with your cohere key:
```
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here
```

5. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
